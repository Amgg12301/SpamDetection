# Spam Detection Web Application

This is a ReactJS web application that classifies user-inputted text as spam or ham (not spam). I created a machine learning model using binomial logistic regression in Python, which this application utilizes to classify a message as spam or ham. The model's accuracy was optimized through preprocessing the text by removing punctuation and stop words and the usage of lemmatization. It currently has an accuracy score of ~94.68%.
